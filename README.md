My name is Hayden Trotter, I am a student at the University of Nebraska Omaha. I am a ACMP major, I decided to choose this major after taking a year of Computer Science in which I was not the biggest fan.
In my free time I like to play games with my friends and play competitively for the UNO esports team.
