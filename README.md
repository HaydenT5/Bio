My name is Hayden Trotter, I am a student at the University of Nebraska Omaha. I am a ACMP major, I decided to choose this major after taking a year of Computer Science in which I was not the biggest fan.
In my free time I like to play games with my friends and play competitively for the UNO esports team. 
I have 4 cats and live with my family which allows me to save up for living in the future. 2 Of the cats are twins named fu and su and the other two are named JJ and DJ. JJ is a outdoors cat that is always outside running around.
